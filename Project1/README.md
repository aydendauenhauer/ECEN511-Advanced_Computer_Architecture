This repository contains my Programming Assignment 1 for ECEN 511, where I completed and analyzed a Tomasulo-style out-of-order execution simulator by implementing the execute and write-back stages, varying operation latencies (such as load delay), and designing a dependency-heavy instruction sequence to verify cycle counts and register values against the expected timing diagrams. The repository includes the modified simulator source code, configuration changes, and a report documenting simulation traces, methodology, and performance observations.
