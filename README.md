# ECEN511-Advanced_Computer_Architecture
ECEN 511 – Advanced Computer Architecture projects, implemented in C. The goal of these projects is to explore advanced architecture concepts, including superscalar and out-of-order execution, pipelining, memory hierarchies and cache coherence, branch prediction, and parallel and multicore systems.
