# ECEN511-Advanced_Computer_Architecture
This repository contains my ECEN 511 – Advanced Computer Architecture projects, implemented in C, Python, and simulation tools at Santa Clara University. The goal of these projects is to explore advanced architecture concepts, including superscalar and out-of-order execution, pipelining, memory hierarchies and cache coherence, branch prediction, and parallel and multicore systems, with an emphasis on performance analysis and quantitative evaluation. The repository includes source code, experiment scripts, reports, and any supporting documentation. This project is shared for personal reference and portfolio purposes only. If you are currently enrolled in ECEN 511, please do not copy this work or submit it as your own. Follow SCU’s academic integrity policies.
